Introduction
============
WY_IniMgr is a C library that provides a simple API to read values from a ini file of the form:

Variable 1 = Value 1 <br>
Variable 2 = Value 2 <br>

How this is different from other ini file parsers:
- The library is developed on a Linux system and excludes using regex.h so it can be easily compiled on Windows systems. Also adhered to using standard C functions to make re-building on other systems easy. 
- MIT license so easy to incorporate in any application.
- Explicitly developed with a simple-to-use API to make it super-easy to use in any application. 

File Organisation
=================
There are 3 directories in the base directory: 

src: All the source files are here. <br>
build: All build files, including the executable, are here. The Makefile is located here as well. <br>
doc: All documentation files are here. HTML Documentation is generated by Doxygen. So only a README and a Doxyfile is in this directory. Users should run "doxygen" in this directory to generate the code documentation.

Usage
=====
Refer to the following example files for how to use the library. This is probably the best illustration as to how to use the library:

WY_IniDefs.h (Modify this for your application.) <br>
main.c <br>
<br>
To build the library and application, just go into the build directory and enter "make".

Explanation of Implementation
=============================

Reading values from a file
-------------------------- 
- wyini_init_read() opens a file and reads the content into a dynamically allocated internal buffer.
- wyini_get_val() is called to retrieve the desired values.
- Internally, the API parses the content line-by-line, so the ini file should be properly written.
- The API also discards trailing whitespace in every line.
- There is no need to double quote string values, e.g. var1 = "value in var1". The API will actually copy the double quotes as part of the variable's value.
- The caller should free the buffer once they are done with reading ini file values.
