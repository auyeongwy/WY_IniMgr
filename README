WY_IniMgr is a C library that provides a simple API to read values from a ini file of the form:

Variable 1 = Value 1
Variable 2 = Value 2

How this is different from other ini file parsers:
- The library is developed on a Linux system and excludes using regex.h so it can be easily compiled on Windows systems. Also adhered to using standard C functions to make re-building on other systems easy. 
- MIT license so easy to incorporate in any application.
- Explicitly developed with a simple-to-use API to make it super-easy to use in any application.
