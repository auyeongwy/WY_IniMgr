WY_IniMgr is a C library that provides a simple API to read and write values from an INI file with variable-value pairs in the following format:

Variable 1 = Value 1
Variable 2 = Value 2

This library has the following key characteristics:
- The library is developed on a Linux system and excludes using regular expression functions from regex.h so it can be more easily compiled on Windows systems without the need to get the associated PCRE library, which in turn adds another dependency.
- It adheres to using standard C functions to make re-building on other systems easy.
- Implements write functions in addition to read functions so users can read and write to INI files.  
- Uses the MIT license so it is easy to integrate into any application.
- Consciously developed with a simple-to-use API to make it super-easy to use in any application.
