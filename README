WY_IniMgr is a C library that provides a simple API to read and write values from an INI file with variable-value pairs in the following format:

Variable 1 = Value 1
Variable 2 = Value 2

This library has the following key characteristics:
- The library is developed on a Linux system and excludes using regular expression functions from regex.h so it can be easily compiled on Windows systems without the need to get the associated PCRE library. 
- It adheres to using standard C functions to make re-building on other systems easy.
- Implement write functions in addition to read functions so users can read and write to INI files.  
- Uses the MIT license so it is easy to incorporate in any application.
- Consciously developed with a simple-to-use API to make it super-easy to use in any application.
